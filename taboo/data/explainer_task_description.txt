Welcome!

    You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe
    a target word for another player to guess.

    Rules:

    1) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.

    2) The same rules apply for the related words that you will be given.

    3) Type the description of the word in the chat at the bottom of the page.

    Guesses from the other player will start with "GUESS".

    End conditions:

    i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.

    ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.

    Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

    Please type "ready" to begin the game!
