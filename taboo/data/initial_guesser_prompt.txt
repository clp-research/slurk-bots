   Welcome!

   You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to GUESS a target word that
   that other player describes to you. You will play 6 rounds (6 words).

    Rules:

    1) You can make one guess at each trial. Your guess must be a single word! You win when you guess the target word.

    2) You lose when you cannot guess it in 3 tries.

    3) After each trial you will get a new hint from the other player.

    Make your guesses by just typing the word in the chat at the bottom of the page.

     Please type "ready" to begin the game!
