                <li>The describer cannot use either the target word or certain related words in the description. The other player must use those hints by <b>making ONE-WORD guesses</b> typing on the chat area and <b>returning</b> them on every turn.</li>
                <li>Each session includes <b>6 target words</b> (~20 minutes) with different difficulty levels (word more or less common words).</li>
                <li>Participants who play -not necessarily win- all 6 rounds successfully <b>following the rules</b> will receive a <b>payment</b>.</li>

                <li>Participants who remain idle or disconnect for more than 5 minutes, causing the session to end, and participants who fail to understand the task after practice <b>will not be allowed to participate in further sessions</b>.</li>
                <li><b>A session will be shut down</b> after the maximum allotted time, 5 minutes of idleness from one player, or 10 minutes in the waiting room (in the event that no partner is found).</li>

                <strong> ⚠️ NOTE: </strong> after completing the sixth word (or end of time-out if partner does not show or finish the task), you will get a unique <strong>Prolific confirmation token</strong>. <u>Remember to copy it and paste it into Prolific in order to get your rewards.</u> Only by doing so you will get paid. ⚠️
