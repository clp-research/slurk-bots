                <li><b>One player describes to another a target word they need to guess</b> by providing instructions in English in a chat window.</li>
                <li>The describer cannot use neither the target word nor certain related words in the description. The other player must use those hints by <b>making ONE-WORD guesses</b> typing on the chat area and <b>returning</b> them on every turn.</li>
                <li>Each session includes <b>6 target words</b> (~20 minutes) with different difficulty levels (word more or less common words).</li>
                <li>Participants who play -not necessarily win- all 6 rounds successfully will receive a <b>monetary bonus</b>.</li>

                <li>Participants who remain idle or disconnect for more than 5 minutes, causing the session to end, and participants who fail to understand the task after practice <b>will not be allowed to participate in further sessions</b>.</li>
                <li><b>A session will be shut down</b> after the maximum allotted time, 5 minutes of idleness from one player, or 10 minutes in the waiting room (in the event that no partner is found).</li>
