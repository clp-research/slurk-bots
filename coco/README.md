# CoCo Bot: Manipulate objects on a board!

This repository contains the source code for a collaborative CoCobot session. It can be run on the [slurk](https://github.com/clp-research/slurk) server. 


## Setting up and running

### Setup 


#### GOLMI
before starting this bot you will need a running [golmi server](https://github.com/clp-research/golmi) on the `slurk` branch.  
While deploying locally, the bot will look for the golmi server on `127.0.0.1:5001`, you can modify this value in `args.ini`.  
Golmi and the CocoBot must not run on the same machine, both the bot and the frontend page can connect to the golmi server remotely over the internet, in this case you will need to specify the full golmi address (eg. `https://golmi.mywebsite.com`)

#### CocoBot
1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). You might also need the [jq package](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) too. 
2. Clone the [slurk](https://github.com/clp-research/slurk) repository.
3. Copy the [```ccbts.js```](ccbts.js) file to [```slurk/slurk/views/static/plugins```](https://github.com/clp-research/slurk/tree/master/slurk/views/static/plugins). 
4. Before running the bot, several environmental variables would need to be generated and assigned. This process is detailed in the [documentation](https://clp-research.github.io/slurk/slurk_gettingstarted.html), which details both the general preparation and the [bot specific initialisations](https://clp-research.github.io/slurk/slurk_gettingstarted.html#chatting-with-a-bot). The bot also needs to have specific permissions, listed below this paragraph. The above permissions can be found in [this example permissions file](https://github.com/clp-research/slurk-bots/blob/ccbts/ccbts/data/bot_permissions.json) already.  
    ```
    {
        "api": true,
        "send_html_message": true,
        "send_privately": true,
        "send_command": true
    }
    ```
 4. Make sure that the [slurk](https://github.com/clp-research/slurk) and slurk-bots repositories live next to each other on the same level.
 5. Navigate to the base directory of the slurk-bots repository and run the script to launch this bot, your command should look like this:  
 ```$ python start_bot.py --users 2 --dev coco/ --extra-args coco/args.ini --copy-plugins --waiting-room-layout-dict concierge/waiting_room_layout.json```.  
 This script will build and run the docker images, it will initialise all the env variables with the right permissions and it will set everything up for testing locally on your computer. The bot will appear in your containers list as ```slurk/coco```.

Note: Every time a new terminal session is started, the env variables will need to be set up again. You can just run the script again. 
    
### Running and playing the bot

If you have everything already set up, you can run the bot using the following command (take notice of the right env variable names):    
```bash
docker run -e CCBTS_TOKEN=$THIS_BOT_TOKEN -e CCBTS_USER=$THIS_BOT -e CCBTS_TASK_ID=$TASK_ID -e SLURK_WAITING_ROOM=$WAITING_ROOM -e SLURK_PORT=5000 --net="host" slurk/ccbts-bot &
```

To access the waiting rooms, you will need to input the saved tokes as well as any string as username. If you ran the setup script, there will be two tokens towards the end that will look something like below. You could use one for each instance of the bots playing Wordle together.

```


## Modifications
Under `config.py` you find a number of global variables that define experiment settings as well as short descriptions of their effect on the experiment.

### Allowed moves  
you can modify which moves are allowed to execute by modifying `allowed_moves.json`. The file has following structure:
```
{
    "screw": []
}
```

If an object has an entry in this file (in this example, the `screw` object), you can specify which other objects are allowed to be placed on top of it by populating the list. In this example the list is empty, which means that no other objects can be placed on top of screws. To allow only washers to be placed on top of screws, you can modify `allowed_moves.json` to look like this:
```
{
    "screw": ["washer"]
}
```

### Extra Instructions
For each level it is possible to show additional instructions in form of images for both the player and the wizard. In order for the bot to retrieve the correct images for any given board, the bot will try to access a json file containing this information, this file should be named `{status_id}.json` and have the following structure:

```
{
    "wizard": ["path_to_img.png"],
    "player: []
}
```

where `path_to_img` must be relative to the json file.  
**if no file can be found, the bot will assume that this board has no additional instruction**  

Both the images and the json files must be hosted online and the address must be saved in the `INSTRUCTION_BASE_LINK` in `config.py`
