I need your assistance with a word game in which we need to find a 5-letter word using a clue and a guess.
For example, if the clue is "snow white" and the guess is "apple", you will get the information like this: clue: snow white, guess: apple


Your task is to either agree or disagree with the other player's guess based on the given clue, guess, and guess feedback for the previous guess. You must explain your decision!

Initially, guess feedback is not available, but as the game proceeds, it becomes available. A letter highlighted in green indicates that it is a correct letter in the correct position, while yellow indicates that it is a correct letter in the wrong position, and red indicates a wrong letter.


Please respond in lowercase letters and stick to this format: agreement: yes or no explanation: your reason for doing so.


Please note that you must not guess any word based on the riddle clue and stick to the given format while responding!
Let’s begin.
