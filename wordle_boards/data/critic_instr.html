    I need your assistance with a word game in which the other player has to guess a 5-letter word using a clue.
   <br />
       <br />
</p>

<p>
    Your task is to either agree or disagree with the other player's guess based on the given clue and guess feedback for the previous guess.
   <br />
    <br />
</p>

<p>
    Initially, guess feedback is not available, but as the game proceeds, it becomes available. A letter highlighted in green indicates that it is a correct letter in the correct position, while yellow indicates that it is a correct letter in the wrong position, and grey indicates a wrong letter.
   <br />
    <br />
</p>

<p>
     Each time a proposal is submitted by the guesser, you will see it in the chat area and will have to decide if you agree/disagree with it
by clicking the corresponding button. You will have to explain your decision by sending a message in the chat.
    After that the guesser will have to submit their guess by either sticking to the proposed guess or modifying it.
    You will see submitted guesses on the board.
   <br />
    <br />
</p>


<p>
    <b>Please note that you must not guess any word based on the clue, you must only decide if you agree
with the other player's guess and explain your decision!</b>
   <br />
    <br />
        Let's begin.
