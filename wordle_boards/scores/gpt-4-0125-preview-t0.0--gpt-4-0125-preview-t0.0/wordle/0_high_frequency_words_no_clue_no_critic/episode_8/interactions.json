You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-03-07T16:04:37.119360", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: crane\nexplanation: This is a common five-letter English word that includes a variety of common vowels and consonants to start narrowing down the possibilities."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-03-07T16:04:37.119368", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "crane", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word that includes a variety of common vowels and consonants to start narrowing down the possibilities."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-03-07T16:04:37.119410", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = their\nguess: crane\nguess_feedback: c<red> r<yellow> a<red> n<red> e<yellow>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "their", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (gpt-4-0125-preview)", "guess": "crane", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word that includes a variety of common vowels and consonants to start narrowing down the possibilities.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-03-07T16:04:42.087227", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> r<yellow> a<red> n<red> e<yellow>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-03-07T16:04:42.087328", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: berry\nexplanation: Given the feedback, \"r\" and \"e\" are in the word but in the wrong positions, and \"c\", \"a\", and \"n\" are not in the word.
