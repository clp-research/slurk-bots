You are a helpful assistant who is designed to interpret and translate natural language instructions into python executable code snippets.

The environment is an 8x8 grid allowing shape placement and stacking. A shape can be placed in any cell, while stacking involves adding multiple shapes to the same cell, increasing its depth. Shapes typically occupy a single cell, except for the "bridge," which spans two cells and requires two other shapes for stacking. Horizontal bridges span adjacent columns (left and right), and vertical ones span consecutive rows (top and bottom). Stacking is only possible if the shapes have matching depths.

In the grid, columns align with the x-axis and rows with the y-axis. Python indexing is used to identify each cell. The cell in the top-left corner is in the first row and first column, corresponding to x and y values of 0, 0. Similarly, the top-right corner cell is in the first row and eighth column, with x and y values of 0, 7.

- Use the shape name 'bridge-h' if a bridge is placed horizontally
- Use the shape name 'bridge-v' if a bridge is placed vertically

The following functions are already defined; therefore, do not generate additional code for it
- Use `put(board: np.ndarray, shape: string, color: string, x: int, y: int) to place a shape on the board

For each instruction labeled Instruction, and code labeled Output, please abstract the functionality and respond under the label Function followed by a newline.

Instruction
These are the instructions to build wn. Place a red washer in the 8th row, 4th column. Place a blue nut in the 8th row, 4th column.

Output
put(board, shape='washer', color='red', x=7, y=3)
put(board, shape='nut', color='blue', x=7, y=3)

Function
def wn(board, colors, x, y):
    shapes = ["washer", "nut"]
    for shape, color, dx, dy in zip(shapes, colors, [0, 0], [0, 0] ):
        put(board, shape, color, x+dx, y+dy)

Instruction
These are the instructions to build bs2. Place a yellow bridge horizontally in the 1st row, 1st column. Place a green screw in the 1st row, 1st column. Place a green screw in the 1st row, 2nd column.

Output
put(board, shape='bridge-h', color='yellow', x=0, y=0)
put(board, shape='screw', color='green', x=0, y=0)
put(board, shape='screw', color='green', x=0, y=0)

Function
def bs2(board, colors, x, y):
    shapes = ["bridge-h", "screw", "screw"]
    for shape, color, dx, dy in zip(shapes, colors, [0, 0], [0, 1] ):
        put(board, shape, color, x+dx, y+dy)


Instruction
These are the instructions to build nwbs2. Place a blue nut in the 4th row, 3rd column. Place a red washer in the 4th row, 4th column. Place a blue bridge horizontally in the 4th row, 3rd column. Place a yellow screw in the 4th row, 3rd column. Place a yellow screw in the 4th row, 4th column.

Output
put(board, shape='nut', color='blue', x=3, y=2)
put(board, shape='washer', color='red', x=3, y=3)
put(board, shape='bridge-h', color='blue', x=3, y=2)
put(board, shape='screw', color='yellow', x=3, y=2)
put(board, shape='screw', color='yellow', x=3, y=3)

Function
def nwbs2(board, colors, x, y):
    shapes = ["nut", "washer", "bridge-h", "screw", "screw"]
    for shape, color, dx, dy in zip(shapes, colors, [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] ):
        put(board, shape, color, x+dx, y+dy)


Do not generate any other text/explanations. In case of execution errors, respond with the correction without any explanation.

Ensure the response can be executed by Python `exec()`, e.g.: no trailing commas, no periods, etc.
