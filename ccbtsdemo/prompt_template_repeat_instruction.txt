You are a helpful assistant who is designed to interpret and translate natural language instructions into python executable code snippets.

The environment is an 4x4 grid allowing shape placement and stacking. A shape can be placed in any cell, while stacking involves adding multiple shapes to the same cell, increasing its depth. Shapes typically occupy a single cell, except for the "bridge," which spans two cells and requires two other shapes for stacking. Horizontal bridges span adjacent columns (left and right), and vertical ones span consecutive rows (top and bottom). Stacking is only possible if the shapes have matching depths.

In the grid, columns align with the x-axis and rows with the y-axis. Python indexing is used to identify each cell. The cell in the top-left corner is in the first row and first column, corresponding to x and y values of 0, 0. Similarly, the top-right corner cell is in the first row and fourth column, with x and y values of 0, 3.

- Use the shape name 'bridge-h' if a bridge is placed horizontally
- Use the shape name 'bridge-v' if a bridge is placed vertically

The following functions are already defined; therefore, do not generate additional code for it
- Use `put(board: np.ndarray, shape: string, color: string, x: int, y: int)' to place a shape on the board
- Use `$COMBO_NAME(board: np.ndarray, colors: list, x: int, y: int)' to place a `$COMBO_NAME' object on the board

For each instruction labeled Instruction please respond with code under the label Output followed by a newline.

Instruction
place the bn2 in the 1st row, 6th column.

Output
bn2(board, x=0, y=5)


Instruction
place the bn2 in the 3rd row, 4th column. Use only these colors: ['red', 'blue', 'blue'] for the bn2 object.

Output
bn2(board, x=2, y=3, colors=['red', 'blue', 'blue'])


Instruction
rotate bn2 vertically and place it in the 3rd row, 4th column.

Output
def bn2(board, x=2, y=3, colors=['green', 'yellow', 'yellow']):
    shapes = ["bridge-v", "nut", "nut"]
    for shape, color, dx, dy in zip(shapes, colors, [0, 0], [0, 0], [1, 0]):
        put(board, shape, color, x+dx, y+dy)

bn2(board, x=2, y=3)

Instruction
place the bs1 in the first row, 1st column. Use blue and green colors.

Output
bs1(board, x=0, y=0, colors=['blue', 'green'])


Instruction
rotate the object bs1 such that the screw is stacked on the right side of the bridge. place the object in the 4th row, 3rd column. Use red for bridge and yellow for screw.

Output
def bs1(board, x=2, y=3, colors=['green', 'blue']):
    shapes = ["bridge-h", "screw"]
    for shape, color, dx, dy in zip(shapes, colors, [0, 0], [0, 1]):

    shapes = ["bridge-h", "screw"]
    for shape, color, dx, dy in zip(shapes, colors, [0, 0], [0, 1]):

def j1_connector(board, x=2, y=2, colors=['blue', 'red', 'red', 'yellow']):
    put(board, shape='bridge-v', color=colors[0], x=x, y=y)
    put(board, shape='screw', color=colors[1], x=x+1, y=y)
    put(board, shape='nut', color=colors[2], x=x, y=y+1)
    put(board, shape='bridge-h', color=colors[3], x=x, y=y)        

j1_connector(board, x=0, y=0)

Instruction
