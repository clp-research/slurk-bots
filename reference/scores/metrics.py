At the episode level, either 0 or 1 whether the game play has been aborted (1) or not (0) 
(due to violation of the game rules e.g. not parsable response or re-prompt for n turns)) 
(this metric does not include games lost).

"""

METRIC_LOSE = "Lose"
"""
At the episode level, either 0 or 1 whether the game play has been lost (1) or not (0) 
(this metric does not include aborted games; the game is lost, when the game goal is not reached 
within the declared number of max_turns, in this sense it’s the opposite of success).

This is always 0 if the game was aborted.

The main score of the game. It is a value between 0 and 100 that summarises
the overall performance of a game play.

1 - ABORTED
This is used by the eval scripts, which infer the % played from the aborted score
This metric should thus not be computed for new games if the given eval
scripts are used, to avoid duplicates.
