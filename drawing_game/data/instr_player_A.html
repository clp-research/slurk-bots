<p>Let us play a game. The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:</p>
<br>
<p>&#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634;<br>
&#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634;<br>
&#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634;<br>
&#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634;<br>
&#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634;</p>
<br>
<p>A filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:</p>
<br>
<p>&#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634;<br>
&#9634; &#9634; E &#9634; &#9634;<br>
&#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634;<br>
&#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634;<br>
X X X X X</p>
<br>
<p>I want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with &quot;&#9634;&quot;. Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say &quot;What is your next instruction?&quot;, and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving instructions. When you have described everything, you say &quot;DONE&quot;.</p>
<br>
<p>For the filled grid above, here are the example steps.</p>
<br>
<p>What is your next instruction?<br>
Instruction: Put an E in second row third column</p>
<br>
<p>What is your next instruction?<br>
Instruction: Fill the last row with X</p>
<br>
<p>What is your next instruction?<br>
Instruction: DONE</p>
<br>
<p>Another example with the following 5 by 5 grid:</p>
<br>
<p>W &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634;<br>
&#9634; W &#9634; &#9634; &#9634;<br>
&#9634; &#9634; W &#9634; &#9634;<br>
&#9634; &#9634; &#9634; W &#9634;<br>
Z &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; W</p>
<br>
<p>What is your next instruction?<br>
Instruction: Put an W in five cells diagonally starting from top left going to bottom right</p>
<br>
<p>What is your next instruction?<br>
Instruction: Put Z in the last row first column</p>
<br>
<p>What is your next instruction?<br>
Instruction: DONE</p>
<br>
<p>Ok. Please do this for the following example.</p>
