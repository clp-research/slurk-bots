<p>Let us draw something together. There is an empty grid with a size 5 by 5, like so:</p>
<br>
<p>&#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634;<br>
&#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634;<br>
&#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634;<br>
&#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634;<br>
&#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634;</p>
<br>
<p>The other player will give you instructions like &quot;put an X in the top left&quot;, and you save the grid (hit 'ENTER') after applying the given instruction, like so:</p>
<br>
<p>Instruction: put an X in the top left</p>
<br>
<p>X &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634;<br>
&#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634;<br>
&#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634;<br>
&#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634;<br>
&#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634;</p>
<br>
<p>Or for another instruction such as &quot;fill the fifth column with T&quot;, you save the updated grid by applying the given instruction in all places that the command corresponds to (and, again, hitting 'ENTER'), like so:</p>
<br>
<p>Instruction: fill the fifth column with T</p>
<br>
<p>X &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; T<br>
&#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; T<br>
&#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; T<br>
&#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; T<br>
&#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; T</p>
<br>
<p>Or for another instruction such as &quot;fill the fourth column second row with P&quot;, you save the updated grid by applying the given instruction in all places that the command corresponds to (plus ENTER), like so:</p>
<br>
<p>Instruction: fill the fourth column second row with P</p>
<br>
<p>X &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; T<br>
&#9634; &#9634; &#9634; P T<br>
&#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; T<br>
&#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; T<br>
&#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; T</p>
<br>
<p>Now start with the provided 5x5 empty grid and execute the following commands at each step. Once you have typed all necessary characters just type 'ENTER' and wait for a message confirming your grid was saved. Do not send any other message to the other player on the chat area.</p>
