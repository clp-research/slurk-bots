<p>Type in letters by clicking on a cell and then typing the desired letter on the keyboard, like this:</p>
<br>
<p>&#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634;<br>
&#9634; &#9634; E &#9634; &#9634;<br>
&#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634;<br>
&#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634;<br>
&#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634;</p>
<br>
<p>Add letters one by one and type 'enter' only when you feel you have followed all instructions in the turn. For example, if the other player says 'Fill the last row with X' do this</p>
<br>
<p>&#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634;<br>
&#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634;<br>
&#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634;<br>
&#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634;<br>
X X X X X</p>
<br>
<p>and then hit 'ENTER'.</p>
<br>
