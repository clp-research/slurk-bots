                <li><b>One player describes to another a grid filled with a letter in various positions</b> by providing instructions in English in a chat window.</li>
                <li>The second player follows the instructions by <b>selecting</b> letters from the grid-board and <b>entering</b> (saving) them on every turn.</li>
                <li>Each session includes <b>3 grids</b> (~20 minutes) with different letters and patterns.</li>
                <li>Participants who complete all three grids successfully will receive a <b>monetary bonus</b>.</li>

                <li>Participants who remain idle or disconnect for more than 5 minutes, causing the session to end, and participants who fail to understand the task after practice <b>will not be allowed to participate in further sessions</b>.</li>
                <li><b>A session will be shut down</b> after the maximum allotted time, 5 minutes of idleness from one player, or 10 minutes in the waiting room (in the event that no partner is found).</li>

                <strong> ⚠️ NOTE: </strong> after completing the third grid (or end of time-out if partner does not show or finish the task), you will get a unique <strong>Prolific confirmation token</strong>. <u>Remember to copy it and paste it into Prolific in order to get your rewards.</u> This is crucial. ⚠️
